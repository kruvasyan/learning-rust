- panama is a library with multi-producer, single-consumer channel implementation.

- strsplit is a library that implements string splitting. StrSplit and Delimiter analogs of [std::str::Split](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/struct.Split.html) and [std::str::pattern::Pattern](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/pattern/trait.Pattern.html).


It is developed through live [coding sessions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_iD0xppBwwsrM9DegC5cQQ) by [@jonhoo](https://github.com/jonhoo). As a viewer of the videos I was repeating the code and figuring out how everything works and sometimes changed the implementation
