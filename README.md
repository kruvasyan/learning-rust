- Panama is a unbounded mpsc channel implementation.

  It is developed through live [coding session Crust of Rust: Channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4mS5UPHh20) by [@jonhoo](https://github.com/jonhoo), which       you can find on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_iD0xppBwwsrM9DegC5cQQ).
As a viewer of the video I was repeating the code and figuring out how everything works.
