I'm learning rust

- panama is a library with multi-producer, single-consumer channel implementation.

  It is developed through live [coding session Crust of Rust: Channels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4mS5UPHh20) by [@jonhoo](https://github.com/jonhoo).
As a viewer of the video I was repeating the code and figuring out how everything works.

- strsplit is a library that implements string splitting.

  StrSplit and Delimiter analogs of [std::str::Split](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/struct.Split.html) and [std::str::pattern::Pattern](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/str/pattern/trait.Pattern.html). It is developed through live [coding session Crust of Rust: Lifetime Annotations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAl-9HwD858) by [@jonhoo](https://github.com/jonhoo).
